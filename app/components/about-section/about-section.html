        <hr class="light" />

        <p>Iâ€™ve worked in the publishing industry for over a decade as a nonfiction book acquisitions editor. I have acquired and edited books across a variety of categories, including outdoor recreation, home improvement and design,
          cookbooks, adventure narratives, and family-focused titles. I specialize in highly designed, instructional books. My edited works include two National Outdoor Book Award winners and a New York Times e-book bestseller.</p>
